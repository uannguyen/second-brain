// Chào, tôi là Laura
Hi, I'm Laura. 
---
// Nấu nướng và làm bánh là niềm đam mê của tôi,
Cooking and baking are my passions, 
// điều này khiến cho nhà bếp trở thành nơi ưa thích của tôi trong căn nhà
which makes the kitchen
my favorite place in the house.
---
// Đó là nơi tôi lan tỏa hạnh phúc trong gia đình 
It's where I spread happiness in my family
// bằng cách chuẩn bị những bữa ăn ngon cho họ.
by preparing delicious meals for them.
---
// Trong nhà bếp của tôi,
In my kitchen,
// có một cái mặt bàn lớn mà tôi thực sự yêu thích.
there's a big countertop that I really love.
---
// Đó là nơi tôi đặt tất cả các nguyên liệu để nấu nướng.
It's where I put all my ingredients for cooking.
---
// Mặt bàn này đặc biệt quan trọng
This countertop is especially important
// khi tôi làm bánh mì,
when I bake bread, 
// vì nó mang lại cho tôi đủ không gian để nhào bột,
as it gives me plenty of room
to knead the dough,
// một quy trình mà tôi thấy vừa bình tĩnh và hài lòng.
a process I find
both calming and satisfying.
---
// Như tôi đã đề cập trước đó,
As I mentioned earlier,

baking holds a special place in my heart.
---
Therefore,
an essential item
in my kitchen is the oven.
---
It's primarily used for baking goodies
like cupcakes or cookies.
---
I often bake these for my children
to take to school
or for my husband to enjoy at work. 
---
Another very important kitchen
item is the stove. 
---
It's good for many ways of cooking,
such as steaming, boiling, and frying.
---
For quick and small reheating tasks,
the microwave oven is very useful,
especially during those busy mornings.
---
Additionally,
we have a sink 
for washing fruits and vegetables. 
---
After meals, the dishwasher
becomes our best friend 
by taking care of the dirty dishes. 
---
It's truly a lifesaver,
making cleaning easy
to keep food fresh
and store fruits and vegetables
so they stay crisp. 
---
A refrigerator is a must-have
in our kitchen. 
---
Every morning,
my husband enjoys tea and toast.
---
This is why we have a kettle and a toaster
in our kitchen. 
---
These small appliances make our
morning routine smooth and delightful. 
---
When I'm in the kitchen,
I always wear my apron. 
---
It's not just a piece of clothing,
it's my baking uniform. 
---
It shows that I'm doing what I love,
getting ready to create something
wonderful for my family to enjoy.
---
This simple piece of fabric also protects
my clothes from spills and stains,
making it a very important thing
for when I cook and bake.
